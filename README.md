## Burger_frontend
I created an online burger ordering website using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js). This project offers a user-friendly interface for browsing and customizing burgers, complete with a seamless ordering process. The backend efficiently handles data management and order processing, ensuring a smooth user experience from selection to checkout.
